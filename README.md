# REALTY-OF-LEGALIZATION-Marijuana-legalization-impact-on-rental-prices-in-the-US
This project examines the impact of marijuana legalization in the states of Colorado and Washington in 2012 and establishes a causal relationship between the rental prices and the legalization in these states. The modelling adopts a difference in difference approach to see the impact on the cities of the affected states vs. the non-affected states. Comparison is done with similar cities using propensity score matching to identify similar cities. The results show an incremental increase in the rental prices in Colorado and Washington compared to other states. The results hold true for multiple analysis (matched states, unmatched states and neighboring states) and placebo test is done to check the robustness of the model.
